The first fragile and wandering step of this tower. 

By one or two flawed, ordinary music lovers,  in their time pried loose from life, trying to mend a little of life’s harsh absurdity.

No one knows whether this will be the last commit, or how many will follow.
But as long as the love for voice remains, and life hasn’t been abandoned, the chaotic tower laden with memories and voices will endure.

Hoping as well... to purge even the barely perceptible dust beside the achievements of those who came before, lying before this towering, unattainable edifice of this reasonless infatuations ...
